        <h2>Easy Moon Lord (Xbox One Version, Normal/Expert)</h2>
        <p>This may be a bug, but I would prefer that nobody would report it, because I have finally found a reliable way to beat the boss. </p>
        <p>If you can get motion sick, this might not be good for you. Also, I believe that this tactic requires a <i>Mechanical Cart</i>, I don't know for sure if it works with a normal minecart. So this is a great tactic if you have a <i>mechanical cart</i> laying around. </p>
        <p>Inside a small house, probably the <i>Nurse</i>'s for extra safety, lay down four minecart tracks with both ends hammered to bumpers, and campfires and heart statues are a good addition. Be sure that the house has a solid roof!</p>
        <p><i>Beetle/Solar Armor</i> best, high tier accessories will definitely help. Weapon(s) MUST be able to go through walls. <i>Stardust Dragon Staff</i> is helpful until close to the end, as it will hold back your maximum dps.</p>
        <p>With the <i>Mechanical Cart</i>, get up to full speed for extra defense, (and probably also activates the bug) and get ready to rumble. The screen will be blurry the entire fight, from the back and forth motion with the cart.  
        <p>Spam your weapon at the eyes, and chug potions or use the <i>Nurse</i> when needed. Once the eyes are defeated, each of their floaty replacements should disappear after charging once.</p>
